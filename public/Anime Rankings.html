    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>When Subaru Natsuki leaves the convenience store, the last thing he expects is 
        to be wrenched from his everyday life and dropped into a fantasy world. Things 
        are not looking good for the bewildered teenager; however, not long after his arrival,
        he is attacked by some thugs. Armed with only a bag of groceries and a now useless cell phone, 
        he is quickly beaten to a pulp. Fortunately, a mysterious beauty named Satella, in hot pursuit 
        after the one who stole her insignia, happens upon Subaru and saves him. In order to thank the 
        honest and kindhearted girl, Subaru offers to help in her search, and later that night, he even 
        finds the whereabouts of that which she seeks. But unbeknownst to them, a much darker force stalks the pair from the shadows, 
        and just minutes after locating the insignia, Subaru and Satella are brutally murdered.

        However, Subaru immediately reawakens to a familiar scene—confronted by the same group of thugs, meeting Satella all over again—the enigma deepens as history inexplicably repeats itself.</p>

    <p>On Earth, stepsiblings Sora and Shiro are two inseparable shut-ins who dominate various online games under the username "Blank."

The mysterious sender turns out to be Tet, who informs them about the world's absolute rules. After Tet leaves, Sora and Shiro begin their search for more information and a place to stay, taking them to Elkia—Imanity's only remaining kingdom.

In the midst of a casual encounter with his colleague, he falls victim to a random assailant on the streets and is stabbed. However, while succumbing to his injuries, a peculiar voice echoes in his mind, and recites a bunch of commands which the dying man cannot make sense of.
    </p>
    <p>When Satoru regains consciousness, he discovers that he has reincarnated as a goop of slime in an unfamiliar realm.

He then stumbles upon the sealed Catastrophe-level monster "Storm Dragon" Veldora who had been sealed away for the past 300 years for devastating a town to ashes. Sympathetic to his predicament, Satoru befriends him, promising to assist in destroying the seal. In return, Veldora bestows upon him the name Rimuru Tempest to grant him divine protection.

    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>For as long as he can remember, Minoru Kagenou has been fixated on becoming as strong as possible, which has led him to undertake all kinds of rigorous training. This wish, however, does not stem from a desire to be recognized by others; rather, Minoru does everything he can to blend in with the crowd. So, while pretending to be a completely average student during the day, he arms himself with a crowbar and ruthlessly thrashes local biker gangs at night. Yet when Minoru finds himself in a truck accident, his ambitions seemingly come to a sudden end. In his final moments, he laments his powerlessness—no matter how much he trained, there was nothing he could do to overcome his human limitations.
    </p>
    <p>But instead of dying, Minoru reawakens as Cid, the second child of the noble Kagenou family, in another world—one where magic is commonplace. With the power he so desired finally within his grasp, he dons the moniker "Shadow" and establishes Shadow Garden: a group whose sole purpose is to combat the enigmatic Cult of Diablos, an organization born from Cid's imagination. However, as Shadow Garden grows in both membership and influence, it becomes increasingly apparent that the Cult of Diablos is not as fictional as Cid had intended.
